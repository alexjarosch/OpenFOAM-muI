# Incompressible ùúá(I) rheology for OpenFOAM

this is a viscosity module for OpenFOAM with a focus on granular flow.
Currently I work on implementing:

* a standard ùúá(I) rheology for incompressible solvers (e.g. interFoam)
* a regularized ùúá(I) rheology for incompressible solvers

as a scientific basis for this work I follow the following papers:

* [Barker, T., & Gray, J. (2017). Partial regularisation of the incompressible ùúá(I)-rheology for granular flow. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 828, 5-32.](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2017.428)
* [Barker, T., Rauter, M., Maguire, E., Johnson, C., & Gray, J. (2021). Coupling rheology and segregation in granular flows. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 909, A22.](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.973)

## Installation

Current development on the main branch is for OpenFOAM version 2406.  
I have stopped supporting OpenFOAM.org versions after the massive code base changes in recent releases, starting with the major solver changes.  
After having installed [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.com) version 2406 on your system, clone this git repository to a directory on your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/alexjarosch/OpenFOAM-muI.git
```
now change into the folder just created and compile the code

```
cd OpenFOAM-muI
wmake libso
```
If you want to clean the build, use
```
wclean
```

## Usage

The viscosity library will be placed into `$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN` and is called `libviscositymuI.so`.
To make use of the library with a solver place the following code at the bottom of `system/controlDict`:
```
libs
(
    "libviscositymuI.so"
);
```

Parameters of the regularized ùúá(I) rheology are defined in `constant/transportProperties`:
```
    transportModel muIreg;
    muIregCoeffs
    {
        mus        0.342;
        mud        0.557;
        muInf      0.05;
        alphaReg   1.9;
        I0         0.069;
        dg         5.0e-4;
        rhog       2500;
        nuMax      1e3;
        nuMin      1e-5;
        pMin       10.0;
        rmHydAirP  true;
        rhoAir     1.0;
        alphaSmall 0.01;
    }
    rho            2500;
```

For an explanation on what the ùúá(I) parameters mean and recommended values for a given granular medium, please consult the published ùúá(I) rheology literature.  
However there are additional parameters I will explain below:  
- `nuMax` and `nuMin` are viscosity value limits that the user can define to avoid unrealistic high or low values
- `pMin` is a pressure limit, required to avoid divisions by zero in the numerics. I find 1 Pascal works well for what I do, but this might be different in your application
- `rmHydAirP` is a binary switch. If `true`, the granular rheology will first subtract the hydrostatic air pressure from the effective pressure before calculating the granular viscosity. This is useful if you have large air masses above your granular medium.
- `alphaSmall` is an additional interface stabilization parameter invented by Alexander H. Jarosch and T√≥mas J√≥hannesson. If set below `1.0`, cells which have `alpha.snow < 1.0` will be treated as if they are completely filled with a granular medium. In the case above, where `alphaSmall = 0.01`, all interface cells that are filled with `alpha.snow >= 0.01` will get the full granular viscosity assigned.


## Examples

In the `tutorials` directory you can find two tutorial cases, which are modified version of the OpenFOAM interFoam tutorial case "damBreak" found in `$FOAM_TUTORIALS/multiphase/interFoam/laminar/damBreak/damBreak/` in your local installation and are inspired by the benchmark of [Balmforth, N. J., & Kerswell, R. R. (2005). Granular collapse in two dimensions. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 538, 399-428.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112005005537). You can run a regularized and a non-regularized version of the examples.

**Note:** To reproduce the actual benchmark data of Balmforth and Kerswell, a more advanced configuration of the example cases is required.  
**Also Note:** The muIreg tutorial case labels the granular phase with `alpha.snow`, because I do alot of avalanche simulations. Within the muIreg rheology module I have to look up the alpha field and there it is hard-coded that the granular phase is called `alpha.snow`. So you can't change that setup without breaking the muIreg module's functionality.

## Which Implementation

Three versions of a ùúá(I) rheology are implemented:
* muI follows the classical, unregularized ùúá(I) rheology, implemented in accordance with equation 2.21 in Barker & Gray 2017.
* muIreg is the regularized version of a ùúá(I) rheology, implemented accordance equation 6.3 in Barker & Gray 2017.
* muIregp is the same regularized version of a ùúá(I) rheology as muIreg, but the module saves less fields, thus suitable for production style runs.

## Regularized ùúá(I) Python utility

In the 'utils' directory there is a Python script which you can use to estimate the I threshold for the ùúá(I) regularization. It is the same algorithm the muIreg viscosity module uses.
