# incompressible 𝜇(I) rheology for OpenFOAM

this is a viscosity module for OpenFOAM with a focus on granular flow.
Currently I work on implementing:

* a standard 𝜇(I) rheology for incompressible solvers (e.g. interFoam)
* a well-posed 𝜇(I) rheology for incompressible solvers
* a compressible 𝜇(I) rheology (one day...)

as a scientific basis for this work I follow the following papers:

* [Barker, T., & Gray, J. (2017). Partial regularisation of the incompressible 𝜇(I)-rheology for granular flow. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 828, 5-32.](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2017.428)
* [Barker, T., Rauter, M., Maguire, E., Johnson, C., & Gray, J. (2021). Coupling rheology and segregation in granular flows. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 909, A22.](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.973)

## Installation

after having installed OpenFOAM on your system, go into this folder and
```
wmake libso
```

## Disclaimer

this code is under development and not yet benchmarked against known granular flow examples. **Use at your own risk!**
